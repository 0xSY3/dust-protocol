          Denomination Privacy
        </h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed mb-3">
          When enabled (default ON), the denomination privacy engine splits your swap amount into
          common-sized ETH chunks (e.g., 1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 ETH). Each chunk is swapped in a
          separate transaction with random 1-5 second delays between them. This prevents amount
          correlation — an observer cannot link your swap to a specific deposit by matching the exact
          amount.

        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed">
          The app suggests nearby rounded amounts that require fewer chunks. Fewer chunks means a
          faster swap and less total gas.

          The reference price comes from a Chainlink oracle, with the pool spot price as fallback.
          Slippage tolerance is configurable: 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, or a custom value up to 50%.
          If price impact exceeds 50%, the UI shows a red warning — this indicates low pool liquidity.

        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed">
          A 2% fee is deducted from the swap output to cover gas costs and relayer operations. The
